When showing an event, the following templates will be tried:
	1. event/event.show.template
	2. form/show.template
	3. a very simple internal editing template

When editing an event, the following templates will be tried:
	1. event/event.edit.template
	2. form/edit.template
	3. a very simple internal editing template

The same mechanism is used for user templates, with in step 1, user/user.xxxx.template, instead of event.

Each template will use handlebars.java as templating engine, for more information see:
	http://jknack.github.io/handlebars.java/
	
Inside the template one can use the following constructs:
	{{>header}}  includes a HTML header, which should be located in the toplevel directory
	{{>footer}}  includes a HTML footer, which should be located in the toplevel directory
	{{#each form.fields}} .... {{/each}} iterate over all the fields for a generic layout
	{{<fieldname>}} e.g. {{form.title}} to access a specific field without iteration

An event has the following fields:
	- title
	- date
	- location
	- min
	- max
	- description

A user has the following fields:
	- username
	- email
	- password

Of each field (e.g. title) one can ask the value, and the following field properties
	{{form.title.value}}
	{{form.title.show}}
	{{form.title.edit}}
	{{form.title.field.name}}
	{{form.title.field.label}}
	{{form.title.field.type}}

When iterating over all fields one should omit the fieldname as follows:
	{{#each form.fields}}
		{{value}}
		{{show}}
		{{edit}}
		{{field.name}}
		{{field.label}}
		{{field.type}}
	{{/each}}

When using the show method (e.g. {{date.show}} or {{show}}) a template specific for the field type is used, as follows
	1. event/event.field.show.<fieldtype>.template
	2. form/field.show.<fieldtype>.template
	3. event/event.field.show.template
	4. form/field.show.template
where <fieldtype> can be any of:
	- TextField
	- TextAreaField
	- PasswordField
	- EmailField
	- DateField

The same holds for the {{edit}} method, with show replaced by edit. Especially a DateField has special date picker logic for in a edit form

When in the configuration
	handlebars.loadDynamic=true
the templates are reloaded whenever they are edited, so that you can test modifications without restarting.

However, at startup of the application all templates are located, and it is decided which templates to use. 
If you add or remove a template, you need to restart the application in order to use the new situation.
